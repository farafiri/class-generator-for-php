```php
  namespace Acme\MyBundle\Entity;
  // \Acme\MyBundle\Base\Entity\Shop is autogenerated class with all methods from xml\yml
  class Shop extends \Acme\MyBundle\Base\Entity\Shop
  {
      public function __toString() {
          return $this->getName() . ' from ' . $this->getAddress();
      }
  }
```
